        "description": "Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐, ma po dou fu) is one of the most popular dishes from Sichuan cuisine. The tofu pieces are braised in a rich spicy, and savoury sauce along with fresh garlic and scallions, with a small amount of ground pork to enhance the flavour. The dish is so appetizing and it goes perfectly with steamed rice.",
